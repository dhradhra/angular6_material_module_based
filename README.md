###### This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

<hr />

## Installation
1. Make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed. This will come with Node Package Manager (NPM), which we will use to install dependencies in the next step.
2. To install dependencies, use your terminal to navigate to the `BATTERY-TRACKING-UI` folder and run the command `npm install`.
3. To use the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI), you will need to install it with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`. If this doesn't work, you may have to retry as `sudo`.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component components/componentName/component-name` to generate a new component that follows our style guide. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

When the app is ready for a real deployment, run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
